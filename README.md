# Hi, I'm Yutong Mao 👋

Welcome to my personal website for P8105 Homework 4.

## About Me
I'm a mathematics student at The Pennsylvania State University (Eberly College of Science), graduating December 2024. My academic focus is in applied mathematics, probability, statistics, and data science, and I’m preparing for graduate-level work in biostatistics and public health data science.

I’m especially interested in:
- Mathematical modeling in biology and public health
- Stochastic processes and differential equations
- Reproducible data analysis in R / Python
- Engineering-style problem solving (validation, optimization, control systems)

## Current Research
I have worked as a research assistant in multiple projects related to mathematical modeling and computation:

- **Talent vs Luck Theory Research (2024 – present)**  
  Building mathematical models and agent-based simulations (NetLogo) to understand how talent and chance interact in “success.” My work includes literature review, refining theoretical frameworks, and simulating different environments to test outcomes.

- **Optimal Anti-amyloid-beta Therapy for Alzheimer’s Disease (2022 – present)**  
  Developing stochastic differential equation models to describe Alzheimer’s disease progression and exploring how to optimize anti-amyloid-beta therapy strategies. This includes work on modeling disease dynamics, simulating possible interventions, and investigating optimization methods for treatment.

- **Mathematical Neuroscience Lab (Jan 2024 – May 2024)**  
  Converted Java code to Python for data analysis, built clustering logic to transform noisy data into meaningful structure, and used NumPy / Matplotlib / scikit-learn to visualize patterns. 

- **Machine Learning Research, DAMI Lab (Sept 2022 – May 2023)**  
  Worked (remote) with the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Explored image denoising using Random Forest + Markov Chain style methods. I focused on integrating local/noise correction from Random Forest with global smoothing through Markov Chain sampling for better image reconstruction.
## Technical Skills
- **Programming:** Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn), MATLAB, NetLogo  
- **Math / Stats:** Linear algebra, probability, mathematical statistics, optimization, stochastic differential equations  
- **Tools:** Anaconda, Overleaf, Git/GitHub, R Markdown / Quarto-style workflows  
- **Languages:** English (Fluent), Mandarin Chinese (Native)

## Outside of Academics
Outside coursework and research, I’ve done applied engineering-style work involving cleanroom / BMS / EMS systems, environmental control, and validation-style documentation for pharmaceutical manufacturing spaces. I like work that mixes strict compliance + math + physical systems.

I also have long-term interests in art (I've trained in painting for 14 years) and I love traveling.
