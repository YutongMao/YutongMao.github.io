## Research Experience

### Talent vs Luck Theory Research  
Research Assistant, Prof. Wenrui Hao’s Lab  
June 2024 – Present, The Pennsylvania State University, USA  
- Building mathematical models to refine a theory of how talent and luck contribute to success.  
- Conducting literature reviews on talent/luck dynamics and inequality in outcomes.  
- Developing agent-based simulations in NetLogo to test different scenarios and quantify outcomes.

### Optimal Anti-amyloid-beta Therapy Project  
Research Assistant, Prof. Wenrui Hao’s Lab  
May 2022 – Present, The Pennsylvania State University, USA  
- Constructing stochastic differential equation models for Alzheimer’s Disease progression.  
- Exploring how to mathematically optimize anti-amyloid-beta therapy strategies.  
- Investigating modeling approaches for understanding disease progression and treatment response.

### Mathematical Neuroscience Lab  
Research Assistant (Data Analysis in Python)  
Jan 2024 – May 2024, The Pennsylvania State University, USA  
- Translated Java analysis code into Python to support more flexible and modern workflows.  
- Wrote algorithms to reorganize random data points into interpretable clustered structures.  
- Used Python libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) for clustering and visualization. 

### Tableau Implementation of the Simplex Algorithm  
Course Project  
Apr 2024 – May 2024, The Pennsylvania State University, USA  
- Implemented the Tableau method for linear optimization problems.  
- Identified the basic feasible solution, pivot column / row / element, and solved for the objective value.  
- Applied the simplex algorithm to real-world style linear programming tasks.

### Machine Learning Research (DAMI Lab, Remote)  
Research Assistant, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, CAS  
Sept 2022 – May 2023, Shenzhen, China  
- Explored machine learning–based image denoising.  
- Combined Random Forest predictions with Markov Chain–style sampling to clean noisy images.  
- Worked on integrating local denoising (Random Forest) with global smoothing / consistency (Markov Chain methods).  
- Performed literature review and helped design an integrated denoising model.  
- Main finding: hybridizing Random Forest and Markov-style sampling improves denoising by addressing both local noise and global structure. 

### ECoS Summer Undergraduate Research Program  
ECoS Scholar Member  
May 2022 – Aug 2022, The Pennsylvania State University, USA  
- Participated in an intensive undergraduate research training program.  
- Worked with faculty mentors on Markov Chains and Stochastic Differential Equations.  
- Built early familiarity with stochastic modeling for biological / physical systems.
